# 👋 Welcome to Kevin Barnes' GitHub Profile!

## 🌟 About Me  
Hey there! I'm **Kevin Barnes**, a **Child Psychotherapist** by day and an aspiring **tech tinkerer** by night. My mission? To make a lasting impact on the mental health of children while exploring the exciting intersections of **psychology** and **technology**.  

I currently work at **Gonzales-Adams**, where I specialize in helping young minds navigate the challenges of life. But that's not all—I’m also a curious soul diving deep into the world of coding, automation, and digital innovation.

## 💼 Professional Life  
- **Job**: Child Psychotherapist  
- **Company**: Gonzales-Adams  
- **Focus**: Developing creative therapy approaches to help children thrive mentally and emotionally.  

Therapy isn't just about talking; it's about understanding. I believe technology can revolutionize mental health care, making it more accessible, personalized, and effective. That's why I’m here—bringing tech into the therapy room (and sometimes, therapy into tech!).

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Journey  
I may not be a full-time developer, but I love to dabble in code! Here’s a glimpse of what I’m passionate about:  
- **Automation**: Making life easier, one script at a time.  
- **Web Development**: Crafting simple, user-friendly tools to support mental health.  
- **Data Analysis**: Unlocking insights from behavioral data to improve therapy outcomes.  

Expect to see a mix of small projects, experiments, and contributions to open-source initiatives here.
